Mostly this is just a project I'm using to learn Kotlin. The grand vision is a site with Tumblr-like posts and reply functionality, but with better UX (not a high bar) and better visibility controls. But that's just something to keep me motivated - I'll only finish this app if I'm having fun working on it.
